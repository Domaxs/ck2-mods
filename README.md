-	PERSONAL STUFF BLAH BLAH BLAH
	These are all my mods for Crusader Kings 2. I moved off of Steam Workshop because a horrendous error not on my end caused me to lose entitlements of my own mods, preventing updates. I'm no stranger to Github, I'm a coder for T4N Restored. Using GitHub will alow other code savy people to expand upon my mods, which is always a good thing, right?
	
	
-	INSTALLATION

	- On the main page for the github repo press the green button named "Code" and press "download zip" from the drop down menu.
	
	- Extract the file that was downloaded and inside open the folder(s) of the mods you want and move those files into C:\Users\(your pc username)\Documents\Paradox Interactive\Crusader Kings II\mod
		For example, if you wanted the Cheat Invasion CB installed, move the "cheat_cb" folder and "cheat_cb.mod" into the path mentioned above.
		
	
	- Open and close the Crusader Kings 2 launcher, then select the mod and you're good. Make sure to uninstall from any of my mods on steam workshop.
	
- UPDATES

	The mods will no longer be automatically updated, to update, repeat first and second steps above and overwrite any files it asks you to.
	
- CONTRIBUTING

	If you're CK2 code savy and want to see your changes and/or additions in the mod itself here's how you can set up Github. If you're familiar with Git, you can ignore this.
	
	- Make a Github account. https://github.com
	- On the main page for the github repository "Domaxs/ck2-mods" press the "fork" button in the top right corner.
	- Download a GitGui for simplicity. I use GitKraken https://www.gitkraken.com/ but you can snoop around and use which ever you like.
	- Read step one for installing a mod manually, this time DO NOT go to the main page and instead go to YOUR fork "(your guthub username/ck2-mods)." Also do not download the zip as it says in the installation guide, instead copy the HTTPS link that is displayed at the top of the drop down menu.
	- Inside your GitGui, find the "Clone a Repostiory" option/menu.
	- Paste the link and choose where you want the new file to go.
	- Any edits made inside this new folder will be saved by your GitGui as commits, except they're not acutally comitted yet.
	- When you make and are done with your edits, commit your changes and push them from LOCAL to REMOTE.
	- When your forked repository has your changes "commits" and you're happy with what you have make a pull request from YOUR BRANCH--->DOMAXS BRANCH on the Github website (easiest to do it there)
	- I review all pull requests. If it is approved, congratulations! That's all there is to it.
	
	That's it for everything in this README. If you have questions about anything, including modding CK2 and such, my Discord is Domaxs#0030.
	
	You can also find me in the T4N discord server, https://discord.gg/c7xZDxRh. If you want to join the team as a coder or localisation person for CK2 or our WIP CK3 mod, we want you! Talk to Squirrel in the server for more info.
